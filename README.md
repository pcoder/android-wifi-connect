android-wifi-connect
==================== 

Just a weekend fun android app project to autoconnect to a wifi hotspot.

My network operator (Buoygues Telecom, FR) provides the public wifi internet by hotspot. Whenever I need to access the internet on my phone or device, I need to open a browser and then enter my credentials on my so small android keyboard. I find this very frustrating and this is what motivated me to write this apk. I am sure, there must already be such application developed by many, but I just wanted to check if I could do one ;)
